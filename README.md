# file-processor
Files to use: fileProcessor_client.py, fileProcessor_lib.py
How to use: 
1.) add both files to a chosen directory. 
  a.) for Studyfind, add the webscraperFunc.py to the directory as well (slightly modified previous webscraper to be a callable function)
  b.) if you want to use any other function for processing, add that file to the directory
2.) modify fileProcessor_client.py as needed (description of parameters and optional parameters in the code)
  a.) for best results, run with createDir=True (the default)
3.) run the code in fileProcessor_client.py
  a.) additional directions will be in the console.
